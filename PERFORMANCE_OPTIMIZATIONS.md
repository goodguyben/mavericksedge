# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Target: Improve PageSpeed Score from 25 to 85+

### Critical Issues from PageSpeed Report:
- **Performance Score**: 25/100
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: 14.5s (target: <2.5s)
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: 5.8s (target: <1.8s)
- **Speed Index**: 12.1s (target: <3.4s)
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: 24.3s (target: <3.8s)
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: 4,360ms (target: <200ms)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: 0.001 (good)

### Major Problems Identified:
1. **Oversized Images/Videos**: 3,045 KiB potential savings
2. **Unused JavaScript**: 912 KiB
3. **Unused CSS**: 237 KiB
4. **Render-blocking resources**: CSS and JavaScript

## Optimizations Implemented:

### 1. Video Loading Strategy (✓ Completed)
- Created `LazyVideo` component that loads videos only on user interaction
- Replaced all `OptimizedVideo` instances with `LazyVideo` in ShowcaseGallery
- Reduces initial payload by ~3MB
- Videos now show a play button overlay until clicked

### 2. Code Splitting (✓ Completed)
- Lazy loaded heavy sections:
  - ShowcaseGallery
  - ServiceCascadeSection
  - ContactSection  
  - WhyChooseUsSection
  - CreativeWorkSection
  - ProcessSection
- Each section loads only when needed with Suspense boundaries
- Reduces initial JavaScript bundle significantly

### 3. Resource Hints (✓ Completed)
- Added preconnect to mavericksedge.ca CDN
- Added dns-prefetch for faster resolution
- Improves connection speed for video assets

### 4. Performance Monitoring (✓ Completed)
- Added WebVitalsMonitor component
- Tracks FCP, LCP, CLS, and Speed Index
- Provides real-time performance metrics in console

## Next Steps:

### 1. Hero Component Optimization
- Check for heavy assets in Hero section
- Optimize any large images or videos
- Ensure critical CSS is inlined

### 2. Font Loading Optimization
- Implement font-display: swap
- Preload critical fonts
- Use system fonts as fallback

### 3. Image Optimization
- Convert remaining images to WebP format
- Implement responsive images with srcset
- Add lazy loading to all images

### 4. Service Worker
- Implement caching strategy
- Cache static assets
- Enable offline functionality

### 5. Critical CSS
- Extract and inline critical CSS
- Defer non-critical styles
- Remove unused CSS classes

## Expected Results:
- LCP: <2.5s (from 14.5s)
- FCP: <1.8s (from 5.8s)
- Speed Index: <3.4s (from 12.1s)
- TTI: <3.8s (from 24.3s)
- Performance Score: 85+ (from 25)

## Testing:
1. Run Lighthouse tests after each optimization
2. Test on real devices with throttled connections
3. Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
4. Track user experience metrics
