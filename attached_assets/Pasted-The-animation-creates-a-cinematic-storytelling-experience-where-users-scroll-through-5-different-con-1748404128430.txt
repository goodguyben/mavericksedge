The animation creates a cinematic storytelling experience where users scroll through 5 different content sections. As you scroll, images transition in a 3D stack while corresponding text content slides in from the right.
The 3D Image Stack Animation
Visual Appearance:

Images are arranged like a deck of cards in 3D space
The active (current) image sits front and center, fully visible and slightly zoomed
Behind it, previous images stack with progressive depth, rotation, and scaling
Ahead of it, future images are positioned with different angles and positions

Stack Behavior:

Active card: Full size, no rotation, bright and sharp with enhanced contrast
Cards behind: Rotate backward (-8° Y-axis), sink deeper (-60px Z-axis), shrink (90-70% size), and fade (80-30% opacity)
Cards ahead: Rotate forward (+12° Y-axis), positioned higher and to the right, more dramatically scaled down (85-60% size)

Visual Effects:

Depth of field: Inactive cards have subtle blur and reduced brightness
Gradient overlays: Active cards get a subtle light gradient for premium feel
Smooth transitions: All movements use sophisticated easing curves (0.8s duration)

Content Animation System
Text Entrance:

Content slides in from the right (50px offset) as images transition
Staggered timing: Title appears first, then paragraph, then button (0.1s delays between each)
Each element has its own upward slide motion (20px) with opacity fade-in

Button Interactions:

Shimmer effect: Light sweep animation on hover
Lift and scale: Rises 5px and grows 5% larger on hover
Enhanced shadows: Drop shadow intensifies with interaction

Scroll-Triggered Progression
Activation Method:

Scroll-based: As you scroll through a tall container (500vh), progress is calculated
Automatic advancement: Also auto-advances every 4 seconds (pauses on user interaction)
Direct navigation: Click progress dots to jump to any section

Smooth Transitions:

Uses cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94) easing for natural, organic motion
0.8-second transition duration for substantial but not sluggish movement

Interactive Elements
Progress Indicators:

Ripple effects: Active dots expand with animated shadow rings
Hover animations: Background circles expand on mouse-over
Visual feedback: Active dot glows with colored shadow and 1.5x scale

Ambient Details:

Floating particles: Subtle animated dots drift upward throughout
Gradient backgrounds: Dynamic color transitions
Responsive design: Stacks vertically on mobile with adjusted timing

The Overall Experience
The animation feels like flipping through an interactive magazine or browsing a premium product showcase. Each scroll reveals a new story with cinematic transitions - images don't just change, they physically move through 3D space while content elegantly appears alongside them.
The effect is immersive and engaging without being overwhelming, perfect for portfolios, product demonstrations, or storytelling websites where you want users to pause and absorb each section's content.
