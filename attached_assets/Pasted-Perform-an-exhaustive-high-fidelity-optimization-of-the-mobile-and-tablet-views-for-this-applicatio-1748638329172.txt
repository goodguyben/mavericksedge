Perform an exhaustive, high-fidelity optimization of the mobile and tablet views for this application, ensuring that the desktop layout is preserved as faithfully as possible across at least 30 of the most widely used devices (covering iOS, Android, foldables, tablets, and large phones).

Objectives:
	1.	üß± Preserve Desktop UI Structure
	‚Ä¢	Retain grid systems, component placement, and hierarchy from the desktop layout across all viewports ‚â•600px unless specific UI/UX issues require override.
	‚Ä¢	Use fluid layouts (Flexbox, CSS Grid) and scalable design patterns that naturally adapt desktop views down to smaller widths.
	2.	üì± Target Device Spectrum (Minimum 30 Devices)
	‚Ä¢	Include iPhone SE ‚Üí iPhone 15 Pro Max, Pixel 5 ‚Üí Pixel 8 Pro, Galaxy S9 ‚Üí S23 Ultra, Galaxy Tabs, iPads (mini, Air, Pro), Surface Duo, and foldables.
	‚Ä¢	Support both portrait and landscape orientations.
	3.	üß† Modern CSS & JS Techniques
	‚Ä¢	Use clamp() and responsive units (vw, vh, %, em) for typography and spacing.
	‚Ä¢	Prefer CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts, avoiding fixed widths or pixel values.
	‚Ä¢	Implement smooth transitions for layout shifts.
	‚Ä¢	Respect safe-area insets on iOS (via env(safe-area-inset-*)).
	4.	üñ±Ô∏è Interaction Design & Input Behavior
	‚Ä¢	Ensure desktop-like hover/focus/active states translate meaningfully to touch interactions.
	‚Ä¢	All buttons, links, and tap targets must meet WCAG minimum (‚â•48px touch area).
	‚Ä¢	No horizontal scrolling unless explicitly designed for it.
	‚Ä¢	Sticky headers and scroll snapping should behave identically to desktop when space allows.
	5.	üåô Additional Modern Features
	‚Ä¢	Enable Dark Mode via prefers-color-scheme.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure keyboard accessibility and responsive ARIA attributes.
	‚Ä¢	Implement responsive images via srcset or <picture> to avoid mobile bandwidth waste.
	‚Ä¢	Optimize meta viewport tag (width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no).
	6.	üìê Media Query Strategy
	‚Ä¢	Use layered, mobile-first media queries:
	‚Ä¢	min-width: 600px (small tablets / large phones)
	‚Ä¢	min-width: 768px (standard tablets)
	‚Ä¢	min-width: 1024px (large tablets / landscape tablets)
	‚Ä¢	min-width: 1280px (standard desktop)
	‚Ä¢	Document each breakpoint and its purpose.
	‚Ä¢	Abstract shared logic into reusable classes or utility-based frameworks (e.g., Tailwind, SASS mixins).
	7.	üß™ Testing Instructions
	‚Ä¢	Use Chrome DevTools to test all key devices and orientations in Device Mode.
	‚Ä¢	Capture full-page screenshots across all breakpoints and compare against desktop fidelity.
	‚Ä¢	Verify accessibility compliance and layout integrity in both portrait and landscape modes.
	‚Ä¢	Provide a final visual regression report (or screenshots) highlighting any deviations from desktop rendering and explain design choices behind those deviations.
	8.	üßæ Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	Refactored CSS/JS (or Tailwind config) with all enhancements.
	‚Ä¢	A list of all breakpoints, overrides, and affected components.
	‚Ä¢	Screenshot comparisons for 5+ key pages across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
	‚Ä¢	Summary of any layout exceptions where full desktop fidelity was not technically or practically possible ‚Äî with rationale.

Constraints:
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Do not alter desktop styles or behaviors unless explicitly required for responsiveness.
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Avoid hiding or collapsing content unless absolutely required for usability.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ All tablet optimizations should prioritize fidelity to the desktop design over mobile paradigms
