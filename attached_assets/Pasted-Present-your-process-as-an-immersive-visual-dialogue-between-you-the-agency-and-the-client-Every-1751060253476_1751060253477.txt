Present your process as an immersive, visual dialogue between you (the agency) and the client. Every phase is not just a step—it’s a shared moment of co-creation. This isn’t a conveyor belt process; it’s an unfolding collaboration where every idea is shaped together in real time.

🎨 Design Direction
	•	Split-Axis Interaction Flow:
Replace the standard vertical or card-based process layout with a horizontal axis of co-creation—left side representing your studio’s touch (strategy, design, development), and right side representing client engagement (vision, feedback, testing).
	•	Animated Blueprint Metaphor:
Use architectural blueprints as interactive visuals. Each process phase is symbolized by a different part of a digital build:
	•	Hovering over “Strategy” causes an animated sketch of a sitemap to fade in and start pulsing with minimal motion lines.
	•	“Wireframe” opens like a folded blueprint sheet expanding outward with subtle paper texture and clickable layers.
	•	“Design” phase introduces grid lines morphing into a color palette selector.
	•	“Development” shows code cascading like scaffolding being placed behind the UI mockup.
	•	“Launch” triggers a crane lifting a finished section into a browser window frame.
	•	Microinteractions:
	•	Cursor hover causes elements to softly illuminate or “breathe” (using subtle SVG animation and blur effects).
	•	Client-side steps use handwritten annotations (like on a blueprint) that animate in as if being drawn live.
	•	Mutual milestones (like “Approval” or “Handoff”) are represented by both sides animating together—e.g., a handshake icon subtly morphs into a launch button.
	•	Sound Optional:
Light UI sounds (paper folding, pencil sketching, scaffold clicks) can be triggered on hover for multisensory feedback.

💡 Why This Works
	•	It embodies true partnership—not just showing what you do, but how you do it together.
	•	Architectural metaphor positions you as thoughtful, precise, and intentional—not trendy and disposable.
	•	No cards, no cliché icons—just meaningful design metaphors and interactive moments that reflect the craft behind your service.
	•	Helps the user feel involved in the creative process—even just by scrolling.
